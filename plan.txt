choose random pixel on image
get pixels adjoining that pixel that are within the chosen threshold of the first one
do this until all pixels are taken
then color each section with average color
    maybe also have black outlines between sections which are thicker if the colors are more different

how does threshold work, how is it determined?
def difference(pixel1, pixel2):
    diff = 0
    for i in range(3):
        diff += (pixel1[i] - pixel2[i])**2
    return diff
I'll try that for now

after that, go through every pixel in the resulting image.  If there is another pixel around that one that is a different color than this one, draw a black circle there.  The radius of the circle is proportional to the difference in color
